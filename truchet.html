<h1>shadertoy 1: truchet</h1>
<h2>18 may 2025</h2>
<p>Wow, it&apos;s been more than a year since my last blog post. I suppose that&apos;s fitting, though, since this year&apos;s been a doozy.</p>
<p>Well, I have some more time now, and I&apos;ve got so much energy to try some new stuff. I&apos;ve been inspired especially by some graphics programming demos that were posted in our CS Club&apos;s show-and-tell channel, as well as Revision Demoparty&apos;s Shader Showdown. I still remember the first time I saw live shader coding; I was genuinely amazed at how much they were able to pull off in just 25 minutes, as well as the level of polish they were able to deliver.</p>
<p>Revision 2025 just happened, and Shader Showdown was once again pretty awesome. While the main event was the addition of compute shaders, one part of Flopine&apos;s submission really caught my eye.</p>

<p>It&apos;s such an elegant pattern, and I wanted to go through my own process of making it in the most optimized way.</p>
