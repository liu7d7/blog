  Hi! I'm Michael Liu, and I like making stuff with code. This blog is supposed to be a catalog of all my projects, so that I can look back on them. Hopefully some of them'll be interesting!

  I generally do projects in one of two categories: game/graphics programming, or programming language/compiler design.
