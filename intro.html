<p>
Hey there! I&apos;m Michael Liu. Below is a catalog of all the projects I&apos;ve worked on since around February 2024!
</p>
<p>
I&apos;ll try to post here regularly. If I make a blog post a month, I&apos;ll have achieved my goal. If I make a blog post a week, then I&apos;ll probably get hired somewhere.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this blog isn&apos;t to get hired, though! I just want to be able to look back on these projects and see the trajectory of my growth over these years, as it&apos;s something I&apos;ve regretted not doing.
</p>
<p>
Well, what are you waiting for? Take a look at my cool stuff!
